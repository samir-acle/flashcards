# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Exceeds expectations**: Great readme! Watch out for your commit messages -- make sure they're all descriptive. If you find yourself writing a nondescriptive commit message, you probably don't need that commit. For example: commit `da8e06d` is "restructured code". While we encourage commit early and commit often, once you get the hang of that it's a good idea to instead commit *intentionally*. I make a lot of use of `git reset --soft head~` to "undo" previous commits so I can add more stuff in. 

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds expectations**: This clearly demonstrates a grasp of event listeners, jQuery selectors, and DOM traversal. It may be worth considering whether you're using *too* much in this project. From an experimentation standpoint, it's awesome! If this is something you intend to publish, though (and I say go for it!) it may be overkill that adds rather a lot of bulk. Maybe not, but personally I prefer the more-with-less approach.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets expectations**: You have a great number of IDs and classes in your HTML, which may not be necessary. Your Javascript is all semantically-named. However, there's an awful lot of it. This makes it pretty tough to maintain. I'd encourage you to work on consolidating all of your functions and variables into a handful of objects, and then dividing those into separate files. The essence of object-oriented programming is having independent objects that clearly "pass" data and functionality between each other, rather than a single monolithic script or object.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds expectations**: Great stuff, Samir! Again, I'd encourage you to keep working on this as a side project and then publish it, even if just to `reddit.com/r/internetisbeautiful`.
