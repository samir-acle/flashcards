#Flash Cards: The Web App

##Installation Instructions
Access the web app by heading to [http://samirmmehta.com/flashcards/](http://samirmmehta.com/flashcards/)

Alternatively, clone this repo and open index.html on your favorite browser

##How to use
This app comes pre-populated with six filler flash cards. These can be deleted and new flash cards can be created to suit your needs.

Click the Flip Button to look at the reverse side of the current flash card.
Mark the card as 'Fully knows', 'Kinda knows', 'Do not know' based on comfort.
You can choose which cards show up by using the deck generator at the bottom of the screen.
By default, only 'do not know' cards are shown.
Clicking the Next Button will change the current card.

Click the hamburger menu on the side of the flash card to open the menu.

In the menu you can:
* Add a new card
* Delete a card
* View the cards
* Show stats for each card

Each flash card is represented by a circle on the left side of the screen. These circles change size and color based on how many times you hvae viewd the card, as well as the comfort level you have set. Click the circle to view the associated flash card.  HINT: might be wise to click on (and study) the bigger circles!
